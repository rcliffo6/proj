A DATABASE FOR COMPARISON SHOPPING

      Within the context of this database, the only entity with one description is a unique gift, 
which may be assigned a serial number and a description based on manufacturer, color, price, and size.
That is, although a t-shirt can be many colors, for this data base, it will be a specific t-shirt 
(say, red) made by a specific manufacturer, in order to comparison shop at numerous retailers, 
i.e., Amazon, Wal-Mart, Macy’s, EBay. So 1NF will be gift with a number, color, emblem, and mfg. 
Thus, there can be numerous t-shirts, but each is distinguished bydifferent color and manufacturer,
requiring a different Primary ID number.
    	Each retailer has different gifts. Each person has received numerous gifts. 
Each gift has numerous prices at different retailers. The same gift can be given upon numerous occasions. 
These all require different tables. These are “one to many” relationships. Therefore, each of these 
attributes require splitting into a separate entity, i.e., Amazon, friends, occasions.
    	Of course, each retailer has different locations to shop - online, different addresses, etc., 
but for the sake of clarity, we will ignore this and assume that for a specific gift, manufacturer, 
and size, there is only one price, and the person can look up the address that’s closest to them.
    	All of these entities have many to many relationships. A gift can be bought from many retailers, 
and a retailer has many of these gifts. Each friend/relative has received many gifts, and each gift 
may have been given to many relatives. These require an associating table between all of them.
